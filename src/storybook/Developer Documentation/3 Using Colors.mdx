# Using Colors In Tailwind

Once you have set up Tailwind and you have imported our custom configuration, 
you can refer to Krones color names in your tailwind classes. See the example below.

### Important

In order for components to use our theme, they need to appear in the DOM inside 
an element that has the `data-theme` attribute (either `data-theme="light"` or `data-theme="dark"`). 
This could either be the `body` element if you are developing a standalone application, or
the root element in the shadow DOM, if you are developing a web component for the FLASH.

## Example

<Demo/>

```jsx
import { classNames } from 'primereact/utils' // utility class for merging class names

<div className={classNames(
    'text-content-bodytext bg-surface-active', 
    'border-4 border-border-primary-accented', 
    'p-4 h-40 w-40 flex justify-center items-center'
)}>
    <span className='text-center'>SOME TEXT</span>
</div>
```

In the example above, we use the following tailwind class names
- `text-content-bodytext`: sets the color of the text to `content-bodytext`
- `bg-surface-active`: sets the color of the background to `surface-active`
- `border-border-primary-accented`: sets the color of the border to `border-primary-accented`

These color tokens map to different colors in different themes. Try switching from "light" to "dark" 
mode to see the difference! Below you can browse through all the colors in the Krones Design System.


## Which Color to Use?

Developers should never need to make desicions regarding colors. This responsibility
falls on the designers. Ideally developers will be working off of Figma mock-ups provided
by the design team, where the colors are explicitly stated (make sure you have "dev-mode" enabled).
The following logic should be used when adding Tailwind class names:

- select component in Figma, and in the colors section, see something like `surface/brand/accented`
- the color token will then be `surface-brand-accented`
- if you are applying this color to the background of an element, the Tailwind class name will be `bg-surface-brand-accented`. 

Note, the default Tailwind colors such as `blue-500` are not usable. Hence, class names such as `bg-blue-500` will not work.
## Implementation of Theme Change

The colors are only defined when inside a "theme scope." In particular, they are implemented in CSS using the following selectors:
- `[data-theme=light] { /* ... */ }`
- `[data-theme=dark] { /* ... */ }`

That means, in your application, you should respond to theme change by 
adding/updating the `data-theme` attribute in some root level element.
Apps that are integrated in FLASH as a web-component can access the 
currently selected theme via the `theme` attribute of the web component, 
whose value is either `light` or `dark`.


## Primitive Colors

Primitive colors do NOT respond to theme change. Hence, they should never be used directly. Instead, 
semantic colors should be used (see below).

<PrimitiveColors/>

## Semantic Colors

Semantic colors map to primitive colors based on the current theme. Try switching the theme
in Storybook to see the change.
