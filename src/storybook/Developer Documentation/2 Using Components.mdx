# Using Krones Components

To use a Krones React component, simply import the component from `@flash/ui-components/[category]/[component]`.
For example, to use the [KButton](/docs/components-button-kbutton--docs):

```jsx
import { KButton } from '@flash/ui-components/button/kbutton';

<KButton 
  label="Krones" 
  disabled={false} 
  icon={<svg> ... </svg>} 
  iconPos="left" 
  size="small" 
  variant="primary" 
/>;
```

More information specific to each component, such as the supported properties, can be found on the corresponding documentation pages. 

### Usage of PrimeReact 

Many components, especially those which have some degree of complexity, make use of the library [PrimeReact](https://primereact.org).
One example is the [KInputDropdown](/docs/components-form-kinputdropdown--docs).
In such cases, we explicitly state this in the documentation, making reference to the exact primereact component being used. Whenever 
PrimeReact components are being used under the hood, the component properties will resemble those of the PrimeReact component, and we will
therefore point you to the PrimeReact documentation to understand how to use those properties. Still, the idea is that the Krones
Component Library provides some layer of abstraction over PrimeReact.
