# Using Spacings In Tailwind

Spacings in the Krones Design System are based on the [default Tailwind spacings](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-spacing). 
This means, you can seamless translate Figma mockups into react code with Tailwind classes. 

## Example

In a Figma mock-up, you may see that the `gap` of a flex container has the value `space-6`:

This means that, in your code, you should use the Tailwind class name `gap-6`

```jsx
<div className="flex gap-6"> 
    some content
</div>
```

> Note, the Tailwind spacing token `6` corresponds to `1.5rem`

Likewise, if in a Figma mock-up you see a container having a `width` of `size-12`, then you should use the Tailwind class name `w-12`. 

```jsx
<div className="w-12"> 
    some content
</div>
```

> Note, the Tailwind spacing token `12` corresponds to `3rem`
