## Menu

### Overview

A **Menu** component is used for navigation and executing commands. It provides a list of options or actions that users can select from. Menus are commonly used in applications to organize navigation links, commands, and settings in a structured and accessible manner.

### When to Use It

-   To provide a list of navigation links or commands.

-   To organize actions and settings in a structured and accessible manner.

-   To offer users a way to navigate through different sections of an application or execute specific commands.

#### **Avoid using buttons when:**

-   The number of options or commands is very small (consider using buttons or links instead).

-   The menu would clutter the interface and overwhelm users with too many options.

-   The actions or commands are better suited for a different layout, such as a toolbar or sidebar.
