## Tab Menu

### Overview

The **Tab Menu** component is a navigation element that displays menu items as tab headers. It allows users to switch between different views or sections within the same context, providing a clear and organized way to navigate through content.

### When to Use It

-   When you need to organize content into distinct sections or views.

-   When users need to switch between different categories or functionalities within the same page.

-   When you want to provide a clear and concise navigation method that is easy to understand and use.

#### **Avoid using buttons when:**

-   When there are too many tabs, which can overwhelm the user and make navigation difficult.

-   When the content within each tab is minimal, making the use of tabs unnecessary.

-   When a different navigation pattern, such as a sidebar or dropdown menu, would be more appropriate for the layout and user experience.

### Dos and Don'ts

#### **Dos:**

✔ Use clear and concise labels for each tab to ensure users understand the content or functionality they will access.\
✔ Group related content under the same tab to maintain logical organization.\
✔ Ensure the active tab is visually distinct from inactive tabs to help users identify their current location.

#### **Don'ts:**

✘ Overload the tab menu with too many tabs, which can confuse users and make navigation cumbersome.\
✘ Use tabs for unrelated content, as this can disrupt the logical flow and user experience.
