## Mega Menu

### Overview

A **Mega Menu** is a navigation component that displays submenus together in the page header. It provides a comprehensive view of available navigation options, allowing users to quickly access different sections of a website or application. Mega Menus are typically used for websites with a large number of categories and subcategories.

### When to Use It

-   When you need to display a large number of navigation options in an organized manner.

-   To provide users with a comprehensive view of available categories and subcategories.

-   To enhance the user experience by reducing the number of clicks needed to access deep navigation levels.

#### **Avoid using mega menu when:**

-   The website or application has a small number of navigation options (consider using a standard dropdown menu).

-   The navigation structure is simple and does not require multiple levels of submenus.

-   The Mega Menu would clutter the header and overwhelm users with too many options.
