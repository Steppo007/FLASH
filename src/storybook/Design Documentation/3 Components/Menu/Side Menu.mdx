## Side Menu

### Overview

The **Side Menu** component is a non-nested side-navigation tab menu used to switch between different content views. It is positioned on the left side of the dialog and provides a vertical list of menu items that users can select to navigate to different sections or views within an application.

### When to Use It

-   When you need to provide a persistent navigation element that remains visible as users navigate through different sections.

-   When the application has multiple distinct content views that users need to switch between frequently.

-   When you want to save horizontal space and provide a clear, organized navigation structure.

#### **Avoid using side menu when:**

-   When there are too many menu items, which can make the side menu cluttered and difficult to navigate.

-   When the application requires nested navigation, as the side menu is designed for non-nested navigation.

-   When a different navigation pattern, such as a top navigation bar or a tab menu, would be more appropriate for the layout and user experience.

### Dos and Don'ts

#### **Dos:**

✔ Use clear and concise labels for each menu item to ensure users understand the content or functionality they will access.\
✔ Ensure the selected menu item is visually distinct from unselected items to help users identify their current location.

#### **Don'ts:**

✘ Overload the side menu with too many items, which can confuse users and make navigation cumbersome.\
✘ Use the side menu for unrelated content, as this can disrupt the logical flow and user experience.
