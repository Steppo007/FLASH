## Avatar

### Overview

The **Avatar** component represents users, entities, or system elements using an image, initials, or an icon. It is commonly used in user profiles and dashboards. Avatars help improve visual recognition and enhance the user experience.

### When to Use It

-   To visually represent a user or entity within an interface.

-   In user lists, profiles, or notifications where identification is needed.

-   To provide a consistent identity marker across applications.

#### **Avoid using an Avatar when:**

-   A name or text label alone is sufficient for identification.

-   The interface does not require visual differentiation of users or entities.

### Dos and Don'ts

#### **Dos:**

✔ Use avatars to enhance user recognition in profile-related interfaces.\
✔ Ensure that initials and icons follow a consistent visual style.\
✔ Use badges for status indicators but keep them subtle.

#### **Don'ts:**

✘ Don't use avatars for non-user-related elements unless necessary.\
✘ Don't rely on an image-only avatar---fallbacks like initials/icons should always be available.\
✘ Don't overload the avatar with too many badges or indicators.
