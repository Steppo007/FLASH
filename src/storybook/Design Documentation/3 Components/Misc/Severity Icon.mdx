## Severity Icon

### Overview

A **Severity Icon** combines the icon of a product with a severity indicator to represent the importance or urgency of a status, message, or event. When the severity is set to "info," the severity icon is not shown, and only the product icon is displayed.

### When to Use It

-   To indicate the severity of an issue or alert alongside a product icon.

-   To provide a quick visual cue for the importance of a message or status.

-   To categorize items based on their priority or urgency while maintaining product context.

#### **Avoid using Severity Icons when:**

-   The information does not require a visual indication of severity.

-   The context is purely informational and does not involve urgency or priority.

-   The icon is used purely for decorative purposes without conveying meaningful information.
