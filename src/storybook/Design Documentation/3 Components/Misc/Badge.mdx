## Badge

### Overview

The **Badge** component is a small, visual indicator used to convey status, categorization, or alerts. It helps draw attention to key information in an interface and can be used in lists, cards, avatars, and notifications.

### When to Use It

-   To highlight important statuses (e.g., "New", "Active", "Completed").

-   To provide contextual information in a compact format.

-   To indicate notifications, categories, or alerts.

#### **Avoid using a Badge when:**

-   The information is too complex (consider using a tooltip or label instead).

-   The user needs to take action on the badge (use a button instead).

### Dos and Don'ts

#### **Dos:**

✔ Use badges for short, impactful labels that add context.\
✔ Choose the appropriate severity to match the urgency of the information.\
✔ Use the outlined variant when placing a badge over another document or UI element.

#### **Don'ts:**

✘ Don't use badges for long text---keep them concise.\
✘ Don't overuse badges on a single screen, as they can become visually overwhelming.\
✘ Don't use filled badges when overlaying another UI element---use outlined instead.
