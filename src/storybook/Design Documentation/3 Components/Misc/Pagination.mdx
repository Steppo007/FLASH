## Pagination

### Overview

**Pagination** is a navigation component that allows users to navigate through large sets of content by dividing them into multiple pages. It provides a structured way to browse data-heavy interfaces efficiently, improving usability and performance.

### When to Use It

-   When a large amount of content needs to be displayed in a structured manner.

-   When users need to move between pages of data, search results, or lists.

-   When loading all content at once would impact performance.

#### **Avoid using Pagination when:**

-   The content can be displayed using infinite scrolling for a more seamless experience.

-   The data set is small enough to be shown on a single page.
