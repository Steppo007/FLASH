## Text

### Overview

The **Text** component allows users to include text using predefined typography styles. It ensures consistency in font family, type, color, size, line spacing, and line height across the application. This component is essential for maintaining a cohesive visual design and improving readability.

### When to Use It

-   To display headings, paragraphs, links, and other text elements.

-   To ensure consistent typography throughout the application.

-   To apply predefined styles for different text elements without manually setting each property.

#### **Avoid using texts when:**

-   Custom typography styles are required that do not match the predefined options.

-   The text needs to be styled differently for specific design purposes.

-   The content is purely decorative and does not require consistent typography.
