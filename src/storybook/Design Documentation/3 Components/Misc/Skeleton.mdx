## Skeleton

### Overview

A **Skeleton** component is used as a placeholder to indicate that content is loading. It provides a visual representation of the layout and structure of the content that will be displayed once the data has loaded. This helps improve the user experience by giving users an idea of what to expect while they wait.

### When to Use It

-   When loading data from an API or server.

-   When the content takes time to load and you want to provide a visual placeholder.

-   To improve perceived performance and keep users engaged during loading times.

#### **Avoid using Skeletons when:**

-   The content loads almost instantly and a placeholder is not necessary.

-   The skeleton component does not match the layout of the final content.

-   The loading state can be better represented by a spinner or progress bar.

### Behavior

-   **Default**: The skeleton component displays a placeholder layout that mimics the structure of the final content.

-   **Loading**: The skeleton component remains visible while the data is being fetched.

-   **Loaded**: The skeleton component is replaced by the actual content once the data has loaded.
