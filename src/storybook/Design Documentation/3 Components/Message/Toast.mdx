## Toast

### Overview

A Toast component is used to display brief messages in an overlay. These messages provide feedback to users about actions they have taken or inform them of important updates. Toasts can appear temporarily and may not require user interaction to disappear.

### When to Use It

-   To provide feedback on user actions, such as form submissions or save operations.

-   To display important notifications or updates without interrupting the user's workflow.

-   To inform users of errors, warnings, or success messages in a non-intrusive manner.

#### **Avoid using toasts when:**

-   The message requires user interaction or acknowledgment (consider using a modal instead).

-   The information is critical and should not disappear automatically.

-   The message is too long or complex to be conveyed in a brief format.
