## Dialog

### Overview

The **Dialog** component is a container used to display content in an overlay window. It temporarily interrupts the user's current workflow, requiring them to interact with the dialog before returning to the main content. **Dialogs** are useful for drawing attention to important information or actions that need to be addressed immediately.

### When to Use It

-   When you need to capture the user's full attention for critical information or actions.

-   When confirming or collecting information from the user, such as in a form submission or confirmation dialog.

-   When displaying detailed information or content that requires focused interaction, separate from the main content.

#### **Avoid using dialogs when:**

-   When the information or action is not critical and can be presented within the main content area.

-   When frequent interruptions would disrupt the user's workflow and lead to a poor user experience.

-   When a non-intrusive notification or inline message would suffice.

### Dos and Don'ts

#### **Dos:**

✔ Use clear and concise titles and messages to ensure users understand the purpose of the modal dialog.\
✔ Provide a clear and accessible way to close the modal dialog, such as a close button or icon button.\
✔ Ensure the modal dialog is appropriately sized for the content it contains, avoiding excessive scrolling.

#### **Don'ts:**

✘ Overuse modal dialogs, as frequent interruptions can frustrate users and disrupt their workflow.\
✘ Use modal dialogs for non-critical information or actions that do not require immediate attention.\
✘ Neglect to provide keyboard and screen reader accessibility, which can make the modal dialog unusable for some users.
