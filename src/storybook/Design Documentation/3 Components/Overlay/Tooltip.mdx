## Tooltip

### Overview

The **Tooltip** component is a subtle and informative UI element that appears when users hover over or interact with specific elements, providing supplementary details or clarifications. Typically displayed as a small, transient box near the target element, tooltips enhance user understanding by offering context without cluttering the main interface. These concise snippets of information contribute to a more intuitive and user-friendly experience, making tooltips a valuable component for guiding users through digital interfaces.

### When to Use It

-   When you need to provide additional information or context about an element without taking up space in the main interface.

-   When users might need clarification or guidance on how to use a specific feature or element.

-   When you want to enhance the user experience by offering helpful hints or tips.

#### **Avoid using tooltips when:**

-   When the information is critical and should be visible at all times, rather than hidden in a tooltip.

-   When the tooltip content is too lengthy, as this can overwhelm users and defeat the purpose of a concise tooltip.

-   When the target elements are on touch devices, as tooltips can be difficult to trigger and interact with on such devices.
