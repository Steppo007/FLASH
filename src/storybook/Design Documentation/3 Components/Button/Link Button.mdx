## Link Button

### Overview

A **Link Button** is a button-styled element that functions like a hyperlink. It is used when an action navigates users to another page, section, or external resource while maintaining the visual prominence of a button. Unlike standard buttons, link buttons do not trigger in-page actions but instead direct users to new locations.

### When to Use It

-   When navigation to another page or external link is required.

-   When the action does not involve submitting data or triggering a process.

-   As an alternative to traditional text links when more visibility is needed.

#### **Avoid using Link Buttons when:**

-   The action requires form submission or an immediate system response.

-   The button is meant to trigger an interactive event (e.g., opening a modal or toggling an element).
