## Icon Button

### Overview

Icon Buttons are compact, action-driven buttons that use an icon instead of text to provide quick access to commonly used functions. They are used when space is limited or when an action is best represented visually.

### When to Use It

-   For actions that are commonly recognized by an icon (e.g., search, close, settings, share).

-   When space is limited and a text button would be too large.

-   As a supplementary action alongside text buttons to enhance usability.

#### **Avoid using Icon Buttons when:**

-   The action is not universally understood by an icon alone (consider using a text button instead).

-   Multiple icon buttons are grouped together without clear differentiation.

-   The action is critical but not immediately obvious to all users (e.g., "Delete" may require a text label for clarity).

### Behavior

-   **Hover:** The icon or button container changes color or opacity to indicate interactivity.

-   **Focus:** A visible outline appears around the button to indicate it is selected (for keyboard and accessibility users).

-   **Active:** Button appears pressed when clicked or tapped.

-   **Disabled:** Button appears grayed out and is non-interactive, preventing user input.
