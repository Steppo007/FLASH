## Button

### Overview

Buttons are interactive elements that allow users to trigger actions. They help guide user workflows by providing clear, actionable touchpoints. Buttons should be easy to identify, accessible, and aligned with the system's visual hierarchy.

### When to Use It

-   To initiate an action, such as submitting a form or opening a modal.

-   To navigate users to another page or section.

-   When an immediate response is required from the system.

#### **Avoid using buttons when:**

-   A **link button** would be more appropriate (e.g., navigation to another page without triggering an action).

-   The action is purely informational and does not require user input.

### Variants

-   **Primary Button** -- The most visually prominent button, used for main actions such as "Submit" or "Save."

-   **Outlined Button** -- A button with a transparent background and a visible border, used for secondary actions that require less emphasis.

-   **Ghost Button** -- A minimal, text-only button with no background or border, typically used for less prominent actions.

### Behavior

-   **Hover:** Button changes color or opacity to indicate interactivity.

-   **Focus:** A visible outline appears around the button to indicate it is selected (for keyboard and accessibility users).

-   **Active:** Button is in a pressed state, showing feedback when clicked.

-   **Disabled:** Button appears grayed out and is non-interactive, preventing user input.
