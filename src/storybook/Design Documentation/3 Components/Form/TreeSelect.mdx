## TreeSelect

### Overview

A **Tree Select** allows users to select one or more options from a hierarchical tree structure. It is commonly used in interfaces where options are organized in a nested manner, such as categories and subcategories.

### When to Use It

-   When users need to select options from a hierarchical structure.

-   When the options are organized in categories and subcategories.

-   When you want to provide a clear visual representation of nested options.

#### **Avoid using a Tree Select when:**

-   The options are not hierarchical (use a standard dropdown or multiselect instead).

-   The list of options is very short (consider using checkboxes or radio buttons).

-   The user needs to input free text (use a text input field).

### Behavior

-   **Hover**: The input field changes color of border to indicate it is interactive and can be clicked.

-   **Focus**: A visible outline of border color appears to indicate the field is active and ready for input.

-   **Active:** The input field shows a visual indication to indicate it is being clicked or interacted with.

-   **Filled in:** The input field displays the entered date, showing that the user has provided input.

-   **Disabled**: The input field appears grayed out and is non-interactive, preventing user input.

-   **Disabled + Filled in:** The input field appears grayed out but still displays the previously entered date.

-   **Error State**: The border changes to indicate an error.
