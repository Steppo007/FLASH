## Input Switch

### Overview

An **Input Switch**  is used to enable or disable a setting. It allows users to make a binary choice, such as turning a feature on or off. Switches provide instant feedback and are commonly used for system settings and preferences.

### When to Use It

-   When the user needs to toggle a setting on or off.

-   When the change takes effect immediately (e.g., enabling notifications, dark mode, auto-sync).

-   When space is limited, and a checkbox would be too bulky.

#### **Avoid using an Input Switch when:**

-   The user must confirm a selection before it takes effect (use a checkbox instead).

-   The selection is not binary (use a radio button for multiple exclusive options).

### Behavior

-   **Hover:** The switch changes color or opacity to indicate interactivity.

-   **Focus:** A visible outline appears around the switch to improve accessibility for keyboard users.

-   **Disabled:** The switch appears grayed out and is non-interactive, preventing user input.

### Text Label Placement

-   The **text label** can be positioned on the left or right of the switch, depending on the UI layout and reading flow.
