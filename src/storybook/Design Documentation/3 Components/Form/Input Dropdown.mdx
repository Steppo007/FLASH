## Input Dropdown

### Overview

A **Dropdown** Input Field allows users to select an option from a list of predefined choices. It is commonly used in forms and interfaces where users need to choose from a limited set of options.

### When to Use It

-   When users need to select one option from a list.

-   When the list of options is too long to display all at once.

-   When you want to save space in the UI compared to using radio buttons.

#### **Avoid using a Dropdown when:**

-   The user needs to select multiple options (use checkboxes instead).

-   The list of options is very short (consider using radio buttons).

-   The user needs to input free text (use a text input field).

### Behavior

-   **Hover**: The dropdown field changes border color to indicate it is interactive and can be clicked.

-   **Focus**: A visible outline appears to indicate the field is active and ready for user interaction.

-   **Active:** The dropdown field shows a list of options to indicate it is being clicked or interacted with.

-   **Filled in:** The dropdown field displays the selected option, showing that the user has made a choice.

-   **Filled in** **+ open:** The dropdown field displays the selected option and the list of options is expanded, allowing the user to change their selection.

-   **Disabled**: The dropdown field appears grayed out and is non-interactive, preventing any user input.

-   **Disabled + Filled in:** The dropdown field appears grayed out but still displays the previously selected option, indicating it is non-interactive but contains data.

-   **Error State**: The dropdown field changes border color to indicate an error, often accompanied by an error message to guide the user.
