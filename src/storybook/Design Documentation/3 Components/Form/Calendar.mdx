## Calendar

### Overview

An **Calendar** (Input Date Field) allows users to enter and select dates using a text field combined with a date picker. This component is commonly used in forms where users need to provide date information, such as booking systems, event scheduling, and data entry.

### When to Use It

-   To allow users to input a specific date.

-   To provide a user-friendly way to select dates without navigating a full calendar.

-   To ensure date input follows a specific format.

#### **Avoid using a Calendar when:**

-   The user needs to select a date range (consider using a date range picker instead).

-   The interface requires a more visual representation of dates (use a calendar component).
