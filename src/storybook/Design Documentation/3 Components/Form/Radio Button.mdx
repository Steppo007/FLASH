## Radio Button

### Overview

A **Radio Button** is a selection control that allows users to choose one option from a set. Unlike checkboxes, radio buttons are mutually exclusive---selecting one option automatically deselects the others in the same group. Radio buttons may include an optional label and additional information for better clarity.

### When to Use It

-   When users must select only one option from multiple choices.

-   When providing mutually exclusive options.

-   When a default selection is required but can be changed by the user.

#### **Avoid using a Radio Button when:**

-   The user needs to select multiple options (use a checkbox instead).

-   The selection is binary (use an input switch for an on/off choice).

### Behavior

-   **Hover:** The radio button changes color or opacity to indicate interactivity.

-   **Focus:** A visible outline appears around the radio button to improve accessibility for keyboard users.

-   **Disabled:** The radio button appears grayed out and is non-interactive, preventing user input.
