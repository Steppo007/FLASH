### When to Use It

-   When users need to select one option from a list.

-   When you want to save space in the UI compared to using radio buttons.

-   When the selection needs to be immediately visible and actionable.

#### **Avoid using a Select Button when:**

-   The user needs to select multiple options (use a multiselect or checkboxes instead).

-   The list of options is very short (consider using radio buttons).

-   The user needs to input free text (use a text input field).
