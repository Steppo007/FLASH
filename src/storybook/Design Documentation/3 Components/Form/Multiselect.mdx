## Multiselect

### Overview

A **Multiselect** component allows users to select multiple options from a list. It is commonly used in forms and interfaces where users need to choose more than one option.

### When to Use It

-   When users need to select multiple options from a list.

-   When the list of options is too long to display all at once.

-   When you want to save space in the UI compared to using multiple checkboxes.

#### **Avoid using a Multiselect when:**

-   The user needs to select only one option (use a dropdown or radio buttons instead).

-   The list of options is very short (consider using checkboxes).

-   The user needs to input free text (use a text input field).
