## Checkbox

### Overview

A **Checkbox** is a selection control that allows users to toggle options on or off. It is typically used for selecting multiple items in a list or for enabling/disabling specific settings. Checkboxes can appear alone or as part of a group, and they may include an optional label and additional information for better clarity.

### When to Use It

-   When users need to select multiple options from a list.

-   When enabling or disabling a setting that does not require immediate submission.

-   When providing an optional choice in a form or interface.

#### **Avoid using a Checkbox when:**

-   The user can only select one option (use a radio button instead).

-   An instant action is required upon selection (use an input switch).

### Behavior

-   **Hover:** The checkbox changes color or opacity to indicate interactivity.

-   **Focus:** A visible outline appears around the checkbox to improve accessibility for keyboard users.

-   **Disabled:** The checkbox appears grayed out and is non-interactive, preventing user input.
