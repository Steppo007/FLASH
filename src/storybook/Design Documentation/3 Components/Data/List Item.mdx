### When to Use It

-   When you need to present a list of items that users can interact with, such as a menu or a list of settings.

-   When you want to display a collection of related items with actions, such as a list of notifications or messages.

-   When you need a consistent and reusable component for displaying items in a list format.

#### **Avoid using list items when:**

-   When the list contains only a few items and a simpler component, such as buttons or links, would be more appropriate.

-   When the items in the list require complex layouts that are better suited to other components, such as cards or tables.

-   When the list is static and does not require user interaction.

### Dos and Don'ts

#### **Dos:**

✔ Use clear and concise text for the headline and supporting text to ensure users understand the content.\
✔ Group related actions and information within the same list item to maintain logical organization.\
✔ Ensure the list item is accessible, providing keyboard and screen reader support.

#### **Don'ts:**

✘ Overload the list item with too much information or too many actions, which can make it cluttered and difficult to use.\
✘ Use list items for unrelated content, as this can disrupt the logical flow and user experience.\
✘ Neglect to test the list item's responsiveness and appearance on different devices and screen sizes.
