## Data Table

### Overview

The **Data Table** component displays data in a tabular format, allowing users to easily view, sort, and interact with large datasets. It is designed to be flexible and customizable, supporting various data types and user interactions.

* * * * *

### When to Use It

-   When you need to present large amounts of data in a structured and easily readable format.

-   When users need to compare data across multiple rows and columns.

-   When you want to provide features like sorting, filtering, and selection to enhance data interaction.

#### **Avoid using a table when:**

-   When the dataset is small and can be presented more effectively using simpler components like lists or cards.

-   When the data does not require complex interactions or comparisons.

-   When a more visual representation, such as charts or graphs, would be more appropriate for the data.

### Features

-   **Show Gridlines:** Whether to show vertical grid lines between cells, enhancing the visual separation of data.

-   **Selection Mode:** Defines if rows can be selected, and how. Options include single selection, multiple selection, and none.

-   **Removable Sort:** When enabled, columns can be restored to their default state after being sorted.

-   **MetaKey Selection:** When enabled, holding down the meta key (ctrl or similar) is required to perform certain operations, like selecting multiple rows or clicking to deselect a row.

-   **Scrollable:** Whether or not the header is sticky while scrolling, ensuring column headers remain visible as users scroll through the data.
