## Pick List

### Overview

The **Pick List** component allows users to select an ordered sublist of elements from a larger list. It provides an intuitive interface for moving items between two lists, typically referred to as the source list and the target list. This component is useful for scenarios where users need to create a custom selection or prioritize items from a broader set.

### When to Use It

-   When users need to select and order a subset of items from a larger list.

-   When you want to provide a clear and interactive way for users to manage selections and priorities.

-   When the selection process requires filtering, sorting, or editing capabilities.

#### **Avoid using a pick list when:**

-   When the list of items is very small and can be managed with simpler selection controls.

-   When the selection process does not require ordering or prioritization.

-   When a different component, such as checkboxes or dropdowns, would be more appropriate for the selection task.
