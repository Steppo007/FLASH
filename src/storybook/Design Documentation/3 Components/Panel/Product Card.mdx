### When to Use It

-   When you need to showcase products in a grid or list format, such as in a product catalog.

-   When you need a consistent and reusable component for displaying product information across different sections of your application.

#### **Avoid using buttons when:**

-   When the product information is too detailed and requires a more comprehensive layout.

-   When the product image is not available or not relevant to the context.

-   When a different component, such as a detailed product page, would be more appropriate for presenting extensive product information.
