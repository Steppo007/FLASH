# Wording

<blockquote style={{backgroundColor: '#eaf2ff', paddingTop: 'var(--space-2)', paddingBottom: 'var(--space-2)', borderColor: '#357de8', borderRadius: '4px'}}>
Clear, precise, and consistent wording is essential for industrial interfaces, where efficiency and safety are critical. The Krones.Digital Design System ensures all UI text follows a structured, intuitive, and action-driven approach to enhance **operator efficiency, reduce errors, and support decision-making** in complex manufacturing environments.

## Principles of UI Writing

Krones softwares and HMI interfaces require:
-   **Clarity & Precision** -- Use direct, unambiguous language to ensure operators quickly understand system status and actions.
-   **Safety-First** -- In industrial environments, wording should prevent critical misunderstandings and potential hazards.
-   **Efficiency** -- Keep text concise, so machine operators and enterprise users can act without unnecessary cognitive load.
-   **Consistency** -- Standardized wording improves recognition and reduces the risk of misinterpretation.
-   **Accessibility & Localization** -- Interfaces should be easy to translate and adaptable for international users.

## General Writing Guidelines

### Be Direct and Actionable

Operators in a fast-paced environment must immediately understand what an action does. Use clear verbs and eliminate unnecessary words.

✔️ **Do:**
-   "Start Production"
-   "Stop Filling Process"
-   "Reset Machine"

❌ **Don't:**
-   "Click here to start the production process"
-   "You may want to stop the filling process by clicking this button"
-   "Please reset the machine if needed"

### Use Standardized Terminology

In an industrial setting, consistent terms improve efficiency and safety.

✔️ **Use:**
-   "Batch Processing" (Not "Workload")
-   "Fault Detected" (Not "Something went wrong")
-   "HMI Control Panel" (Not "Screen Interface")

### Avoid Ambiguity

Operators need precise and informative text to prevent errors.

✔️ **Do:**
-   "Temperature exceeds safe limits. Reduce to 40°C."
-   "Production halted due to missing bottle caps."

❌ **Don't:**
-   "Temperature is too high!" (What is "too high"?)
-   "Something is wrong with the machine." (Unclear problem and no guidance.)

<hr/>

## UI Text Best Practices

### Buttons & CTAs
-   Use strong, direct verbs related to machine control and production processes.
-   Prioritize clarity over brevity in safety-critical actions.

✔️ **Do:**
-   "Start Conveyor"
-   "Stop Production Line"
-   "Confirm Batch Settings"

❌ **Don't:**
-   "OK"
-   "Click Here"
-   "Confirm" (Without context)

### Headings & Titles
-   Use sentence case for clarity.
-   Make sure headings reflect critical system states.

✔️ **Do:**
-   "Set Cleaning Cycle Parameters"
-   "Machine Status: Running"

❌ **Don't:**
-   "CLEANING CYCLE SETTINGS" (All caps is harder to read)
-   "Welcome to the cleaning system page" (Unnecessary information)

### Error Messages
Errors must be clear and instructive, guiding the operator on the next steps.

✔️ **Do:**
-   "Valve pressure too high. Reduce to 2.5 bar."
-   "Bottle caps missing. Load new caps and restart."

❌ **Don't:**
-   "Warning!" (No context)
-   "Something went wrong"

### Warnings & Critical Alerts
-   Warnings should use direct, urgent language.
-   Clearly indicate consequences and required actions.

✔️ **Do:**
-   "Emergency stop activated. Check safety lock before restarting."
-   "Overheat detected! Shut down system immediately."

❌ **Don't:**
-   "Caution! Be careful!" (Too vague)

<hr/>

## Formatting & Capitalization

### Capitalization
-   Use Title case for UI elements, buttons, and labels.\
    ✔️ "Start Production"\
    ❌ "START PRODUCTION"

### Punctuation
-   Avoid unnecessary punctuation on UI elements (e.g., no periods on buttons).\
    ✔️ "Restart Machine"\
    ❌ "Restart Machine."

### Units & Measurements

-   Always include units for industrial parameters.\
    ✔️ "Temperature: 40°C"\
    ❌ "Temperature: 40"

## Industrial Contexts & Safety Considerations

Since Krones products are used in food & beverage production, clarity in system messaging directly impacts safety, compliance, and efficiency.

**Key Considerations:**
-   **Regulatory Compliance:** Ensure messages align with food safety and industrial hygiene standards.
-   **Preventative Warnings:** Provide clear pre-emptive messages to avoid machine damage or contamination.
-   **Localization Awareness:** Messages should be easy to translate for global teams.

✔️ **Example of Good Compliance Messaging:**
-   "Cleaning cycle incomplete. Restart required to meet hygiene standards."

❌ **Bad Example:**
-   "Cleaning not finished. Please check." (Unclear if action is mandatory.)
-   "Cleaning not finished. Please check." (Unclear if action is mandatory.)
